## üõ†Ô∏è How It Works

The extension uses a content script that runs on LeetCode pages. Here's a breakdown of the key files:

* **`manifest.json`**: This is the main configuration file for the Chrome extension. It defines the extension's name, version, permissions, and the scripts to be loaded.
* **`content_script.js`**: This script is injected into LeetCode pages and is the core of the extension's logic. It monitors the page for changes in the submission status. When it detects a failed submission (e.g., "Wrong Answer," "Time Limit Exceeded"), it triggers the overlay and sound effect.
* **`wasted.css`**: This file contains the styling for the "SUBMISSION REJECTED" overlay, controlling its appearance and positioning.
* **`assets/`**: This directory contains the images and audio files used by the extension.
    * `wasted.png`: The image displayed on the overlay.
    * `wasted.mp3`: The jingle that plays on a failed submission.
    * `icon16.png`, `icon32.png`, `icon48.png`, `icon128.png`: The icons for the extension.
